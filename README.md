# DailyPlanner
This planner works by importing the datetime Library in python. With this, you are able to keep track of the times and dates of different tasks. Essentially, the planner works by you being able to input a task at a certain time, then have the program be able to tell you how much time you have until that task or until the next task.
## How To Operate DailyPlanner
In order to operate the program, you must select one of five numbers (1/2/3/4/5). Selecting 1 would allow you to add a new task and input the date and time. Selecting 2 as an input would allow you to display your current tasks. Selecting 3 as an input shows your time until next task. Input 4 allows you to mark any task as completed by name. and task 5 exits the program.
